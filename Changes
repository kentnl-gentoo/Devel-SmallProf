Revision history for Perl extension Devel::SmallProf.

1.13  31 Oct 2003
	- support for SMALLPROF_CONFIG
	- add grep-mode output
	- eliminate DB::sub overhead under perl 5.8.0 or
	  newer (feature commented out)

1.12  31 Oct 2003
	- Compensate DB::dub overhead (patch by Chris Sander)
	- README changed to follow current uses

1.11  19 May 2003
	- version number bumped to 1.xx because 0.9 > 0.10

0.10  19 May 2003
	- Fixed to work under perl 5.8.0
	- test file names changed to be more Windows friendly

0.9   8 Aug 2000
        - Fixed up test suite to work under 5.6.0.

0.8  26 Jul 2000
        - Made SmallProf -w-clean (at least so far as I can tell :-)

0.7  28 Jul 1999
        - Some cleanup on sub profiling and locales
        - fixed up and added some tests

0.6  11 Jul 1999
        - Cleanup on part4.t and part1.t (Thanks!)
        - Removed special Win32 support as Time::HiRes now works on Win32 
        - Fixed a bug in sub sub where $1 and $2 were getting clobbered.
        - Increased size of execution count column
        - Added CPU times

0.5
        - Added rudimentary subroutine profiling.
        - Set ref to keep code listings around for non-subroutine-defining
          evals.
        - Added support for .smallprof (the options file).
        - Lots of work to make Win32 stuff work correctly.

0.4  12 Jan 1998
        - Removed the use vars--fully specifying all non-my variables.
        - Added $DB::profile flag to turn profiling on and off.
        - Added %DB::packages support to profile only in certain packages.
	- Read source lines from @main::_<file instead of from disk files.
	  This saves having to save eval lines during the run as well.  Still
          missing some eval code, though.
        - Better nulltime compensation.
        - Use formats instead of printf for output.
        
0.3  20 Nov 1997
        - Folded in changes by Geoffry Broadwell ('f) for Win32, creating
          converter to convert between the two.  Attempted to make that 
          conversion automatic (see Makefile.PL).
        - Folded in Paul Ewing's changes to use Time::HiRes instead of 
          syscall
        - Removed need for $DB::print_lines

0.2  12 Aug 1997
	- Better (though still not really good) eval handling.

0.1  Wed Jul 30 13:44:40 1997
