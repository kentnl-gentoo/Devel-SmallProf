Good ideas that might be worth adding with appropriate attention to the
dangers of feeping creaturism:

- Use the rusage call (in UNIX, at least) and gettimeofday to remove dependance
  on Time::HiRes and to give processor time reports.

- Write a coverage script to go with SmallProf to do coverage analysis.

From Philippe VERDRET:

- And some other ideas:
  o build a wrapper for launching the program to profile: so you can
    define and manipulate easily many profiling options. In the pass
    I have used this program:

        #!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
        use File::Basename;
        BEGIN {
          $^W = 0;
          ($basename, $dirname, $suffix) = fileparse($0, '\.pl');
          push(@INC, "$dirname");
        }

        use Getopt::Long;
        $usage = "usage: $basename program to profile";
        &GetOptions('h',                # Help
                    'l:s',              # -l logfile, not used
                   ) or die "$usage\n";
        $^W = 1;
        die "$basename: $usage$EOM" if not @ARGV;

        if (not -s $ARGV[0]) {
          die qq!$basename: no program to profile$EOM!;
        }
        $ENV{'PERLDB_OPTS'} = "NonStop=1";
        $ENV{'PERL5DB'} = qq!BEGIN { require "$dirname/myprof3.pl" }!;

        # Execute
        print STDERR "$basename - Launching context: $^X -d @ARGV\n";
        exec $^X, '-d', @ARGV;

    Just a crude version.

  o don't compute the time statistics during the runtime, just collect
    informations and display the profile later, with a specific program.
    (Editor's note.  Hmm... concerns about time and space usage.  Definitely
      do not want to do disk i/o anytime during the run.)

From Ed Peshko:

- Add the ability to just profile a certain subroutine and all of its 
  underlying subroutines rather than the whole thing.
  (Editor's note: The $DB::profile variable could do something like this.  
    Set it to zero at the beginning of the script (or in .smallprof) and then
    set it to 1 at the beginning of the sub and 0 at the end).

- Another idea: I noticed that when SmallProf profiles, in subroutines it
  doesn't count all the 'sub code' underneath the code itself. Hence, when you
  say something like:

  a();

  sub a { take_a_long_time(); }

  a comes out as '.005' seconds. How easy (as an option) would it be to have a
  summation, so that the call to a() reflects the call to take_a_long_time()?

  (Editor's note:  The sub sub (just added) might allow something along these
    lines, but there doesn't seem to be a call made when a subroutine *returns*
    and I'm afraid that the cost of faking it up would be high).
